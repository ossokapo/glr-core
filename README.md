# 🛡️ Ground Layer (GLR)

**GLR is a privacy-first, mobile-first Layer 1 digital currency** built for real-world payments, business adoption, and stealth finance.

> Like Monero meets Apple Pay — private by default, transparent by choice.

---

## 🔍 Mission

To make **private money usable globally** — from tipping at a café to SaaS payments and smart treasury exits.

GLR empowers users and businesses with:

- Zero knowledge, zero surveillance
- Real usage, not speculation
- Ethical smart contract controls (not hype games)
- On-chain logic that never leaks identity

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

GLR combines:

| Layer                        | Stack / Language          |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Blockchain Core             | Monero fork (C++)         |
| Smart Modules               | Cosmos SDK (Go)           |
| Wallet UX                   | React Native (TypeScript) |
| zk-Audit Proof Generator    | Noir / Circom / Rust      |
| Admin Tools                 | React + TypeScript        |

## 🧩 Folder Structure

| Folder              | Purpose                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `/glrd`             | Core blockchain daemon (Monero fork, renamed)     |
| `/glr-wallet`       | CLI wallet with referral, bonus, and stealth keys |
| `/wallet-ui`        | Mobile-first stealth QR wallet                    |
| `/src/audit/`       | Local zk-proof generator (Noir/Circom)            |
| `/src/referral/`    | Referral logic, fraud filters, reward unlocks     |
| `/src/liq/`         | Smart contracts for liquidity & exit control      |
| `/src/biz-onboard/` | Business tools (QR gen, signage, staff guides)    |
| `/dashboard/`       | Admin panel: fund approval, fraud reviews         |

## 🛠️ Build Order (MVP)

1. ✅ Fork & rename Monero → `glrd`
2. ✅ Build CLI & Mobile wallet → `glr-wallet`, `wallet-ui`
3. 🔒 Add zk-audit logic → `src/audit/`
4. 🎁 Add referral system → `src/referral/`
5. ⚖️ Add liquidity guard smart contracts → `src/liq/`
6. 🧑‍💼 Launch admin dashboard → `dashboard/`

---

## 🔐 Core Principles

- **Privacy by default** (RingCT, stealth addresses)
- **zk-Audits** that expire, generated locally
- **Referral + bonus model** (business-led)
- **Smart contract guardrails**, not speculation
- **No data custody** — user has full control
